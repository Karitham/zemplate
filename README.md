# zemplate

Zemplate is a *WIP* zig templating engine.

The syntax is inspired by html/template from go, but is farm from complete.

I'm still looking for a way to make the argument passing more flexible to render, such that we can insert any kind of data into the template.

I'm open to any and all contributions, be it from code-review, documentation or any form of critique, especially since this is my first zig project.
